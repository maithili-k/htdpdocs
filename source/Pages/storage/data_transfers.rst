On this page you will find general information about data transfers to and from
the HT-platform.

.. _data-transfers-within-ht:

=====================================
Data transfers within the HT-platform
=====================================

To transfer data between directories located within the HT-platform we advise
you to use the unix commands ``cp`` and ``rsync``. Other options may be
available, but these are currently not supported by us.

Help on these commands can be found by (i) typing ``man cp`` or ``man rsync``
on the command line after logging into the system, or (ii) by contacting
:ref:`our helpdesk <helpdesk>`.


.. _data-transfers-to-and-from-ht:

==============================================================
Data transfers to and from external storage to the HT-platform
==============================================================

To transfer data to and from the HT-platform we advise you to use ``scp``,
``rsync`` or ``wget``. Other options may be available, but these are currently
not supported by us.

Help on the above commands can be found by (i) typing ``man [COMMAND]`` after
logging into the system. For those cases that require another client for data
transfers is necessary we kindly request that you to contact us via
