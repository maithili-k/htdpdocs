What is the HT-platform
************************

.. _service-overview:

--------
Overview
--------

The HT-platform is a versatile High Throughput data-processing facility aimed at
processing large structured data sets. It runs on top of our in-house elastic
data-processing cloud, allowing for scalable processing of many terabytes of
data, or even petabytes, utilizing many hundreds of cores simultaneously, in
exceedingly short timespans. Superb network throughput ensures connectivity to
external data storage systems.

Apart from scaling and capacity, the platform is aimed at interoperability with
other services, allowing for a high degree of integration and customization into
the user domain, and further enhanced by specific features supporting
collaboration, data (re)distribution, private resources or even private
HT-platform instances.
