For whom
********

The platform is suitable if you are a researcher in climate & earth sciences,
astronomy, engineering, life sciences or other scientific field and you face
one or more of the following challenges:

* Processing of large amount of data, in scale of many TeraBytes
* Processing of large amount of independent simulations (or jobs)
* Co-working with your collaborators on the same project-based workspace

The platform is not intended for:

* HPC applications where operations per second are critical
* Processing of simulations that require multi-node execution (i.e. MPI)
* Applications that cannot be ported on Linux-based system
* Long-term preservation of data
