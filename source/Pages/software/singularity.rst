=============================
Containers on the HT-platform
=============================

On the HT-platform we support Singularity. Singularity is a container solution
for building software stacks in the form of images. Singularity enables these
images to be run in user space. We dot not provide a space for building
Singularity images, but we do support the execution of these images by users
on the HT-platform.

The currently supported version of Singularity on the HT-platform can be found
by typing ``singularity --version`` on the command line after
:ref:`login <login>` into the system. Additional information can be found
on `Singularity SURFsara`_ page and more generic info can be found at the
`Sylabs documentation`_.
