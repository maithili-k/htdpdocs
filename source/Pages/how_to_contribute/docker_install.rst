******************************
Setup readthedocs Docker image
******************************

===========
Preparation
===========

Before you start with the Docker image, make sure that:

* You have `Docker Engine installed <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_
* Docker is running on your host
* You have cloned the ``htdpdocs`` repository

===========
Build image
===========

The Dockerfile for this image can be found in ReadTheDoc's GitHub
repository: https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs-docker-images
It is also added as a submodule.

To build the image in Linux, run:

.. code-block:: console

   $git submodule init
   $git submodule update
   $cd readthedocs-docker-images
   $sudo docker build -t rtfd-build:base base/

.. note:: In Mac OS X (with boot2docker or docker-machine), you can use the same command (``docker build``), except you do not need to prefix the build line with ``sudo``.
